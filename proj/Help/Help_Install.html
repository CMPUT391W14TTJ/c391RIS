<h1>Installation</h1>
<hr width="100%"> 

<h2>Web Server Install</h2>
<p>
All files inside the proj folder must reside at your web servers root directory where
the radiology system will reside. All links are relative and no folders or files 
need to be moved once they are put in their proper location. 
</p>
<h2>Initializing the database</h2>
<p>
There is a make file that can be used to setup your database with the proper tables 
and with a initial admin user set to Username: admin, password: Admin. This make file
is located in the scripts folder and should be run from there. The make file can be 
altered to use a different username and password for sql plus login.  
</p>
<h2>Other Info</h2>
<p>
There is a make file inside the main system folder. This can be used to run the scripts
and to ensure the web files have the right permissions however this file will not
work properly if any of the folders are moved or renamed so be aware of this. 
</p>
<p>
The web files and folders may need their persmissions reset if the site is not working.
Chmod 755 for folders and 644 should work.
