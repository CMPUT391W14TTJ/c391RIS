<h1>Data Analysis</h1>
<hr width="100%"> 

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This is a module only accessable by the system administrator. Its use it to display
the number of images in the system for any combination of patient and/or test type
and/or time periode. 
</p>
<h2>How to Search</h2>
<p>
There are two checkbox's, one labled 'Patient Name' and another labled 'Test Type'. 
Checking a box will cause the report to group the number of images by one, both or
none of these criteria. If select 'Patient Name' we would be given the number of
images for each patient for each time periode specified. The same goes for test type
or for the combination of both.  
</p>
<p>
The time periode drop down has 4 options. They are week, Month, Year and total. This
selection allows you to decide how to devide the number of images by time periode. 
Selecting for example 'Patient Name' and Month would tell us how many images each
patient has for each month. Selecting only 'Total' for example would simply tell us 
how many images exist in the database as a whole.
</p>
<p>
One can drill down or up by selecting a new set of options in one direction or another
and re-submitting the search.
