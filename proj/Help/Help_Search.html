<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This module allows any registered user to search the database for a list of
relavant records and as well to view the medical images associated with it. The
search is bounded by the users security level however such that patients can
only seem records on themselfs, doctors on their patients, radiologists on any
records they uploaded and administrators can see all. 
</p>
<h2>Generating the Search</h2>
<p>
All fields are optional however inputting no date range and no keyword(s) will return
no results. The keyword search is very simple and thus a record will be returned if one of the 
keywords exists in either the patient name, the record description or the diagnosis. 
</p>
<h2>Ordering</h2>
<p>
The results can be ordered in one of three ways. Ascending by date, decending by date
or the default which is ranked by keyword frequency in the three seach fields.
</p>
<h2>Advanced Search</h2>
<p>
If one would like to search for the name 'John Smith' a regular keyword search would 
return such names as 'John Doe' or 'Steve Smith'. To get only name containing 'John Smith' 
search using '&' to bridge together two or more words into a single unite. The search would
then become 'John&Smith' and would not return 'John Doe'.
