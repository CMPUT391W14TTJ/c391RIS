<h1>Report Generator</h1>
<hr width="100%"> 

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This module allows the system administrator to generate reports listing patients
with a specific diagnosis for a given time. 
</p>
<h2>Generating the Report</h2>
<p>
There are three required fields for each search. The first is the 'Diagnosis' box
which is where keywords for the search based on diagnosis goes. This is a simple search
and thus a keyword of 'cancer' would return results like 'breast cancer' and 'brain cancer'. 
A search of 'cancer tumor' would return results such as 'brain cancer' and 'brain tumor'. 
<p>
The other required fields are a start date and a end date. This will bound your search
to a specific time periode. 
</p>
<h2> Advanced searching</h2>
<p>
If one
would like to search 'brain tumor' but do not want results such as 'large tumor' or 'brain cancer'
search using 'brain&tumor' where '&' is used to bridge two or more words that we would like to
search as one unit. A seach for 'brain&tumor' will however return results containing 'large brain tumor'.
